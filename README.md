Requirements
============
View list of cards with Sample data provided using Reactjs

Installation
============
1. Nodejs - install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Clone this repo - git clone https://github.com/HMEaton-JS/ReactCode.git
3. cd ReactCode -> npm install
   
6. Start server locally - 'npm start'
7. Verify UI in browser with url - 'http://localhost:3000/'

Implementation approach and Challenges
======================================
1. Used PxBlue and material-ui wherever required.

2. Custom implementation of ScoreCard Component is added as part of Library

3. Created new custom ScoreCard component. Refer readme file for usage of this component https://github.com/HMEaton-JS/ReactLib/blob/master/README.md


Recommendations
---------------
1. Currently HeroBanner component doesnot support one Hero item. The usage should support one component as well.

2. The value of 'children' and 'badge' parameter provided in ScoreCardList can be optimized as seperate components.

3. The 'styles' added in the Components can be seperated in other file based on coding guidelines.
